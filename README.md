## Code

Unfortunately, the representations obtained for AOC and WSE (more info in the paper) were obtained using proprietary 
job postings. Therefore, some code snippets in the `.py` files might not work or needs modification (is indicated in 
the files) to make it work to your needs.

Nevertheless, we hope that this repository is still useful.
